CF gen for headless and headful cookie genning

# setup
npm i to install dependencies
Server.js - non multi thread 
server2.js - multithread

# extra stuff
Use the click when running headless , set useragent override when doing headless on linux systems (i was too lazy to do this so im open sourcing lol) 
Headful works fine on all Operating Systems

didnt add proxy but that should be easily doable, got finals and dont want to spend the time to do it (sorry sarto)
